#!/bin/bash
# This is a shell wrapper script that launches the command invoked by workflow
# This hack is needed as SGE requires the invoked command to be a shell script
# Hence when users rerun the same commands under SGE they would have to make no
# changes to the workflow document

# Invoke the command through the eval
#echo $*
eval $*
