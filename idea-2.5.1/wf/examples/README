Workflow 2.1 BETA EXAMPLES
==========================

The examples directory under the Workflow 2.1 Beta installation
contains a few example configuration and template files.

Each pair (A config file and the corresponding template file)
have the same name with appropriate extensions. The format of 
the names is '<NAME>.ini' and '<NAME>_template.xml'

Example names for a valid pair of config and template files may
be 'simple_dce.ini' and 'simple_dce_template.xml'.

All the examples may work successfully with the 'CreateWorkflow' 
tool but may not guaranteed to work successfully with the 
'RunWorkflow' tool.
